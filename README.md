# movie_api
 My tasks included setting up the project, writing code in Node.js, creating a REST API with Express and MongoDB, implementing user authentication, and deploying it to Heroku.  
 Implementing authentication ensured data security. Using REST principles made the API clear and scalable.  
 I might explore additional features, improve error handling, and enhance code documentation for future projects. 
 This project taught me valuable full-stack development skills, including API design, database management, and deployment. 
 Proficiency in the MERN stack and Heroku deployment will benefit future projects.
